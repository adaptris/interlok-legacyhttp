This uses `com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpServer` as its HTTP server of course; it is included for the situations where you don't want to use Jetty as your HTTP Server. To be honest it was only developed as a stop-gap for our users who didn't want to upgrade to Jetty-9.4 (which requires Java 8). It is not actively developed and relatively unloved; but could still be useful for as long as `com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpServer` remains part of the JRE.
